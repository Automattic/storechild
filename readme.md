## Storechild

Child theme starter for [Storefront](https://www.woothemes.com/storefront/).

---

The following things are configured in the child theme:

- Script loading
- Frontend JavaScript detection
- Header Image
- Default extension values
- Initial extension configuration
- Header Search/Cart compatibility snippet
- Child theme Javascript file


### Default Storefront and Extension values

Storechild uses `storechild_defaults()` to automatically set some defaults for you in
the customizer. This is useful to have your defaults organized. You just need to add
the Storefront/Extension options into the returned array and youâ€™ll be all set.
